# Indian Dish Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a data science project that focuses on building a recommendation system for Indian dishes. The recommendation system suggests the top 5 similar dishes to a given input dish, allowing users to discover new and similar dishes based on their preferences. The project employs various Python libraries and machine learning algorithms, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and vectorization techniques.

## Features
- Recommends the top 5 similar Indian dishes based on user input.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for content-based recommendation.
- Implements vectorization techniques to transform dish descriptions into numerical features.
- Uses pandas and numpy for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
